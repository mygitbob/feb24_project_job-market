We are digitising the largest and most fundamental industry in the world, the industry that literally builds the foundations of the civilisation we all depend on to spare us from a brutal hunter-gatherer life: CONSTRUCTION. It is one of the least digitised industries in the world but also the largest – 1 in 9 people globally work in the construction industry and it constitutes 11% of global GDP. Improving construction strengthens the very foundation of human civilisation.

We are building a full suite of products one module at a time – kind of like office 365 but for construction management.

We are digitising the largest and most fundamental industry in the world, the industry that literally builds the foundations of the civilisation we all depend on to spare us from a brutal hunter-gatherer life: CONSTRUCTION. It is one of the least digitised industries in the world but also the largest – 1 in 9 people globally work in the construction industry and it constitutes 11% of global GDP. Improving construction strengthens the very foundation of human civilisation.

Read on!\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe are Shape.Construction! We are digitising the largest and most fundamental industry in the world, the industry that literally builds the foundations of the civilisation we all depend on to spare us from a brutal hunter-gatherer life: CONSTRUCTION. It is one of the least digitised industries in the world but also the largest – 1 in 9 people globally work in the construction industry and it constitutes 11% of global GDP. Improving construction strengthens the very foundation of human civilisation. (Watch our short film about it here: \u003ca href=\"youtu.be/PxcBZupiI7Y\"\u003eyoutu.be/PxcBZupiI7Y\u003c/a\u003e).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe got our start as a high-end construction project management consultancy.

      "\u003ch2\u003eJob Description: Lighting Designers\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe're looking for 2 lighting designers to join our practice at Elektra, at junior and intermediate level.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3\u003eAbout Us\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe are a long-established (24 years) award-winning lighting consultancy based in London. Our work focuses on Hotels, Retail, Exterior, and more. With projects all across Europe and the Middle East, Elektra Lighting Design is a great place to work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFirstly, a major perk - we operate a 4-day week, so Fridays are off every week. We work a full-time 35-hour week (with full pay) spread over Monday to Thursday. Then, we adopted a permanent hybrid part office/part home working pattern. However, we would want you to be in full time for the first few weeks at our office in Holborn to settle in. And if that's not enough, we have an in-house training program and team structure to encourage your development.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3\u003eAbout You\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou should be an enthusiastic, hardworking, creative, and self-motivated individual. We're recruiting at both junior and intermediate levels. For Junior, no experience is needed, but always welcome. For full intermediate, you have commercial use in at least some of Dialux, AutoCAD, InDesign, and Photoshop (and maybe REVIT). You can prepare visuals, renders, have familiarity with some lighting manufacturers, and know your way around a design meeting, along with experience in taking projects (as part of a team or solo) through the design process and possibly some site experience too. Multiple languages are always a bonus (we work across EMEA region).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSo if you are anywhere on this range of junior to intermediate, we'd love to hear from you! We are committed to equal opportunities, so we would especially love to hear from you if you are from any sort of minority, even if you don’t think you quite have everything it takes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eNote: Just to be completely clear; we are not product designers. We don’t design light fittings, in the same way that architects do not design bricks. We create well-lit architectural spaces using light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou must be a UK citizen or already have a work visa; we cannot get a UK work visa for you; we are really sorry about that. Do Not Apply if this is you, and no we will not take you on remotely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003ePlease send your CV and portfolio immediately, marked “Application for lighting designer position”.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eNeil Knowles\u003cbr\u003e\nElektra Lighting Design\u003cbr\u003e\nneil@elektralighting.co.uk\u003c/p\u003e",

For nearly two decades, people have been using YNAB and then telling their friends what a difference it has made in their lives. Check out our community on Facebook, TikTok, or Reddit (really!), or read some of our app reviews, and you'll see what we mean.

Which leads us to your next amazing quality: You're an excellent communicator. You're not the gatekeeper for what spending is and is not okay, but you excel (get it?) at helping people understand the intent of the budget. You provide spending guidance and information that empowers them to make spending decisions and complete individual and team purchases. Most of all, you're extremely detail-oriented and deadline-driven—because making sure everyone gets paid accurately and on time is no small task.

You'll make sure all invoices are entered into our accounts payable/spend platform (Airbase), move them through the correct approval flow, and manage all vendor information.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eYou'll also be responsible for managing our team stipends. You should be skilled at creating helpful internal documentation and keeping it up to date, managing and assisting teammates with purchases in Airbase, and delivering proper reporting for the financials.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eFinally, you'll help with the month-end financials and budget processes. These tasks may vary, but to start you can expect to assist with stipend reconciliations and updating various team expense trackers.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThat's a brief intro to what you'll be working on. But first, you need to know if you'll even like working with us. Let's talk a bit about life at YNAB, and then we'll go into more detail about what we're looking for.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYNAB started in 2004 and we haven't taken any outside funding—we're established, profitable, and in this for the long haul. We have one overarching requirement when it comes to joining our team: our original Core Value Manifesto has to really click with you. If you're nodding emphatically while reading it, you'll probably really like it here, and we can't wait to hear from you!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe live our Core Values every day at YNAB, and we mean it when we say we are an equal opportunity employer. We believe that a diversity of backgrounds, abilities, beliefs, and experiences is critical to our success, and we are passionate about creating a welcoming, supportive, and collaborative environment for all employees. All are encouraged to apply as we continue to grow a smart, hard-working, and diverse team that loves working together to build something that matters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe also work really hard, together, to make working at YNAB an amazing experience, and we're (humbly) proud to have received many of Fortune's \"great place to work\" awards over the last several years. We have a team full of truly exceptional people—the kind you'll be excited to work with. We'd love to introduce you to a few of them!\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3\u003eWho you'll be working with:\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou'll work most closely with Lauren, our Accounting Specialist, who will also be your manager. Lauren obsesses about numbers and how to explain the story behind them. She loves to budget, and spends her time outside of YNAB teaching others about YNAB. When she's not jamming on her 10-key, you can catch Lauren attempting a new recipe or trying a new pizza restaurant with her family.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou'll also work closely with our HR team, Caitlin and KC. Caitlin runs point on most things related to HR—comp, benefits, and state laws to name a few. She loves YNAB and how it allows her to work and be a mom to three ridiculously cute boys. Her happy place is on the beach (preferably Maui) with a Diet Coke in hand. When she's stuck in the snow in Utah, you can find her reading a book, watching reality TV, and planning her next vacation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eKC rounds out the HR team as our HR Specialist, where she gets to dive into making YNAB the best it can be for our team members. She lives the small-town life with her partner and stepsons in a coastal community in the Pacific Northwest, and has a serious knack for international travel. As a self-proclaimed extrovert, KC's adapted well to remote-working through her exuberant emoji use (she really wants to :wave: at you right now) and her \"is it an Asana comment or is it a stream-of-consciousness diary entry?\" style of communication; she looks forward to celebrating your arrival with both!\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBigger picture: You'll be on the Ops team, so you'll definitely get to know Chance, Emily, Jess, Charlene, Emma, Sara, and Amber too. Our job is to make working at YNAB the best experience ever—so if the Why behind all the numbers you're crunching excites you, you're in good company. We love our people!\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaking of our people, you'll probably cross paths with—well—everyone at YNAB. (After all, we all get paid and we all spend money!) We can't even list them all, really. But we can say that we are all excited to get to know you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3\u003eHow You'll Work at YNAB\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eNow that you've met some of your potential future teammates, let's talk more about YNAB as a company. Here's how we operate:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLive (Almost) Anywhere You Want\u003c/strong\u003e: We've always been a fully remote team, and have people all over the world. For this particular position, however, we're only considering candidates based in the United States. Anywhere in the U.S. is fair game though. Just make sure you have a reliable internet connection.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWork \u003cstrong\u003eFour Day Week\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e: We've adopted a \u003cstrong\u003efour-day work week\u003c/strong\u003e (still 100% paid!) and rarely work more than that. There are occasions and seasons where things get busy and people put some extra time in—but then we encourage them to take some extra time off, too. We work hard and smart and we care deeply about what we do, but we also love our families and about 2,000 other things. We have perspective and, ultimately, we think it makes us—and our work—even better.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFlex Your Work Schedule\u003c/strong\u003e: We're fully remote, so a lot of our work is done asynchronously, but we love working together in real-time when it makes sense. We try to schedule most meetings between 12-3pm Eastern time Monday-Thursday. Outside of your meetings, we trust you to set your own schedule by balancing your team's needs with your own needs. You don't need to ask for permission to take off early one afternoon to see the doctor, or be \"active\" on Slack if you're working deeply on a project. We look at what you accomplish—not when or how long you're in front of a computer.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTake Vacation (Seriously)\u003c/strong\u003e: We want you to take vacation. In fact, we have a minimum vacation policy of three weeks per year. Five weeks feels about right (plus two extra weeks for our company-wide December Break). It's important to get plenty of downtime and to get out and do something. We'll look forward to seeing pictures of your adventures in our #office-wall Slack channel!\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e",

For nearly two decades, people have been using YNAB and then telling their friends what a difference it has made in their lives. Check out our community on Facebook, TikTok, or Reddit (really!), or read some of our app reviews, and you'll see what we mean. We love building something that has a huge positive impact on people's lives.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBefore we can help them love their spending, people need to trust YNAB with private details of their lives. And to those who work here, YNAB embodies years of relentless effort to craft something uniquely wonderful. Honoring that trust and protecting the company we're proud of is why this position of Security Lead exists. Our Security Lead is dedicated full-time to safeguarding YNAB, and they have a single primary outcome to achieve:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKeep YNAB Secure.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou're the Security Lead we're looking for if the thought of anchoring our commitment to protecting YNAB and its customers resonates deeply. You navigate security complexities with a blend of technical expertise, empathetic leadership, pragmatic problem-solving, and an eagerness to go hands-on. You take ownership of security, including assessment, strategy, communication, and execution.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you're the one we're looking for, you have high standards for all aspects of security. You cultivate, evangelize, and teach these standards—and hold the organization accountable for them. But you don't dictate security by fiat; you nurture the team and work alongside them to surface the decisions and approaches best suited to YNAB.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3\u003eRequirements (these are real, actual requirements)\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe're looking for a leader and doer in security, but that doesn't mean you've held a specific title for a particular time. We expect you'll be most successful in this role if you have at least five years of deep and rich experience in a SaaS environment (whether that be in security, engineering, or management).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn this role, you'll have three main responsibilities:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eYour primary focus will be cybersecurity—protecting our systems and data from digital attacks, theft, damage, and unauthorized access. This requires employing a wide range of techniques, technologies, processes, and practices to safeguard the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of our information and systems from a growing volume and sophistication of cyber threats.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eYou'll partner with Operations on compliance to ensure our security practices, policies, and procedures meet industry standards and regulatory requirements.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eYou'll take ownership of the relevant technical and security aspects and help with implementation efforts. You'll also be responsible for customer protection, working to help users be more secure by evaluating and improving YNAB measures that allow customers to protect themselves.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThat's a super brief intro to what you'll be working on. But first, you need to know if you'll even like working with us. Let's talk a bit about life at YNAB, and then we'll go into more detail about what we're looking for.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYNAB started in 2004 and we haven't taken any outside funding—we're established, profitable, and in this for the long haul.

He lives in an old farmhouse in Switzerland with his partner Tina, three dogs, and nine cats. They love living in the countryside, where Sebastian continues to convince himself that handyman skills can be learned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBuffy has been a Buffy since before Buffy the Vampire Slayer, and one of her life regrets is not buying buffy.com while she was in college. She loves a good debugging session. When she's not cleaning up our infrastructure, she's probably knitting socks, biking, or otherwise frolicking outdoors with her family. She's a lifelong New Englander, so be sure to tell her you love vacationing \"in Cape Cod\" and then please, watch her face very carefully for a reaction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eChance gets to obsess about building a great company and making sure that people really love their work at YNAB. He cares deeply about YNAB and the people who make it a success. When he's not championing the YNAB team experience, you'll find him with his family outside in Southern Utah, usually on a hike, a mountain bike, or the lake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTruthfully, you'll have interactions and influence across much of the organization and probably cross paths with many at YNAB at some point. We can't even list them all, really. But we can say that we are all excited to get to know you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3\u003eHow You'll Work at YNAB\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow that you've met some of your potential future teammates, let's talk more about YNAB as a company. Here's how we operate:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch4\u003eResponsibility and Empowerment\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eYNAB appreciates, respects, and trusts the expertise and judgment of its people. We empower them to do what they think is right.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eWe also work collaboratively. We continuously seek the right amount of structure and unity necessary to maximize productivity. Where it makes sense, we designate someone to make a call.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eEven though our people are right a lot, it's okay to make mistakes here. Exploration and calculated risks are vital to velocity and growth. We freely admit when we're wrong. If something doesn't go as expected, we learn, bounce back, and make corrections.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eYou won't be alone; others will be there to help, review, reassure, and back you up. We own our processes and collective outcomes as a team.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003ch4\u003eLive (Almost) Anywhere You Want\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe've always been a fully remote team, and have people all over the world. For this role, you'll need to be located somewhere between the Pacific Time Zone (UTC-8) and the Central European Time Zone (UTC+1). For instance, North America and most of Europe work well. Wherever you are, just make sure you have a reliable internet connection. Like, a really good one. Please.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e4 day week\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch4\u003eFlex Your Work Schedule\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe're fully remote, so a lot of our work is done asynchronously, but we love working together in real time when it makes sense.

You'll generally have the opportunity to meet with your team once or twice a year, at a small-team work-focused meetup, or at our company retreat. At the YNAB retreat, we love to catch up on spreadsheets and powerpoints in a Best Western conference room. Just kidding. (It's actually hard to write that sentence, even knowing it's a joke.) So far, we've gone to Costa Rica, a gigantic cabin in the mountains, a beach house in the Outer Banks, a ranch in Montana, Laguna Beach, and most recently, Palm Springs. We work together, play together, and reinforce the bonds we've made as a team and company. Every time we meet up, we leave refreshed, motivated, and excited for the year ahead together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch4\u003eUp Your Game\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe're serious about helping you improve your craft. It's one of our favorite savings categories, and it's the most important work of our managers. Think conferences, online courses and subscriptions, dedicated time away from work to learn something new… It's really up to you and your manager. But we love to see our people grow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch4\u003eOther Benefits\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur team is spread all over the world—mostly in the United States, but also in the UK, Canada, Germany, Brazil, Mexico, and several other countries. Team members who live in the US or UK are set up as employees, and those who live in other countries set themselves up as independent contractors. No matter where you live, you're eligible for our generous paid family leave, vacation, holidays, and sick time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you're in the US, we also offer fantastic health, dental, and vision insurance, where we cover 100% of the premium for you and your family. No need to check your vision, you read that right—100%. (Although if you did need to check your vision, NBD, we've got you covered!) We also have a Traditional and Roth 401(k) option, where YNAB matches your contributions up to six percent, and matches vest immediately.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you're in the UK, we also contribute six percent to your pension.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch4\u003eCompetitive Compensation\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt YNAB, we're committed to equitable, market-driven, data-based compensation and we aim to offer a competitive benefits package to our team members. The starting salary for this role will be between $142,000 - $170,000 USD annually (with the top of that range reserved only for the most experienced candidates). If we decide to make you an offer, we'll determine the most appropriate number based on what we know about your experience and competency for the role, and then we'll make you our best offer and hope that you accept! If you join our team, you'll also be eligible for a raise once a year and for our profit-share twice a year. (YNAB wins, you win—that kind of thing.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3\u003eA Few Final Tidbits\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce you start, we DEMAND (in a friendly, ALL CAPS IS YELLING way) that you fill out your \"Bucket List\" spreadsheet with 50 items. (That's harder than it sounds!)\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe love to celebrate with you when you complete something on your bucket list—AND, we love using your bucket list as inspiration for your best birthday present(s) ever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe want you firing on all cylinders, so we'll set you up with a shiny new computer and replace it every three years. Did we mention that YNAB makes a huge, positive difference in people's lives? You may not think that matters much, but then a few months down the road, you'll realize it's made your job really, really enjoyable. Don't underestimate this one!\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf this sounds like your ideal environment, read on because now we want to talk about you, and how you'll play a big part in changing people's lives.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eNow back to you, our new Security Lead....\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs our Security Lead you know that safeguarding our customers, the company, and the team is critical to our success, and you're passionate about security outcomes. You have an empathetic and pragmatic approach to driving safety and integrity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis is a big-picture-but-also-hands-on role. As our Security Lead, you have broad technical skills in security in a SaaS context, are adept at analyzing risk, prioritizing initiatives and issues, and have the drive and experience to personally complete a comprehensive set of security tasks. You are committed to being in the day-to-day work, bold about diving into details, and willing to roll up your sleeves and engage with any security job at hand. You readily act in circumstances of less-than-perfect knowledge and know getting started is often more important than waiting for the ideal process. You also know how to balance pragmatism with process.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe big-picture part of the role comes in the form of a leadership aspect, and as our new Security Lead you have the mindset of owning security at YNAB. You'll help us figure out what to do to keep YNAB safe and move things forward until we achieve those objectives. You are someone who can inspire with practical and effective communication.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eLet's get down to brass tacks: As we mentioned earlier, your three main responsibilities will be to ensure cybersecurity, assist Operations with compliance, and promote customer protection. Here are some possible examples of what this might look like in practice—but know that you'll also help us shape this role and determine what's most important to focus on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThat's a whopping twenty bullets!
