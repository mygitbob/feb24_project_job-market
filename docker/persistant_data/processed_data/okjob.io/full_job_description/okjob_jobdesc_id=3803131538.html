<h3>The Role</h3>

<p>Hutch is looking for an experienced Technical Artist to join the team in our Central London studio. We believe in small autonomous teams that have a lot of freedom and responsibility.

<p>A Tech Artist at Hutch should be someone who is adaptable and willing to work on a wide variety of challenges. We are happy to hire someone who needs to brush up in a few areas but is keen to help as the bridge between the artists and coders, being able to work iteratively in the mobile constraints and being up for the challenge of working on a variety of tasks is going to be key for the role.</p>

  <li>Maintaining a holistic understanding of all aspects of the technical art for a project, including the render pipeline, asset loading/unloading, UI structure and flow, etc.</li>

  <li>Experience with scripting</li>
  <li>Experience with 3D packages, preferably Maya</li>
  <li>Experience with Photoshop</li>
