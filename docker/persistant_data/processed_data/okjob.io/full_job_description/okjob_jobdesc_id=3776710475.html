<h2>Job Description: Platform Engineer</h2>

<p>Ever wondered how it would be to revolutionise one of the least digitised industries in the market, alongside a growing and switched-on team? Read on!</p>

<h3>About Us</h3>

<p>We are Shape.Construction! We are digitising the largest and most fundamental industry in the world, the industry that literally builds the foundations of the civilisation we all depend on to spare us from a brutal hunter-gatherer life: CONSTRUCTION. It is one of the least digitised industries in the world but also the largest – 1 in 9 people globally work in the construction industry and it constitutes 11% of global GDP. Improving construction strengthens the very foundation of human civilisation. (Watch our short film about it <a href="youtu.be/PxcBZupiI7Y">here</a>).</p>

<p>We got our start as a high-end construction project management consultancy. As a consultancy, we are focused on genuinely upgrading the way construction projects are delivered. We then take the deep understanding of the projects we work on to develop construction management software products that anyone can use to deliver their projects better. We are building a full suite of products one module at a time – kind of like office 365 but for construction management. (Check out <a href="www.shape.construction/">www.shape.construction/</a>, our construction management tech and watch this video about what we are doing <a href="youtu.be/tgi4hW3G_NY">here</a>).</p>

<p>The core of all this is our true secret sauce; people. We only recruit the very best both in capability and personality. We are deeply focused on designing a new type of organisation that is optimised for the flourishing of the people in the team first and foremost. People that join us develop fast as a whole person in ways they never imagined. (Read more about our vision and mission <a href="www.shape.construction/join-us/">here</a>).</p>

<p>This approach has allowed us to grow from just 2 people in 2017 to over 160 today (including consultancy) and we are still very much at the beginning! Joining us isn’t just some “job”, it is a transformative educational experience. We challenge you to be your best self in all aspects of life.</p>

<h3>4 Core Values for a Good Life</h3>

<p>We believe a life of human flourishing is all about meaningful relationships with others and challenging yourself to create a positive impact. So our values reflect the 4 levels of relationships that each of us has:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Grow yourself – Your relationship with yourself</li>
  <li>Care about people – Your relationship with others around you</li>
  <li>Execute to greatness – Your relationship with your team</li>
  <li>Build civilisation – Your relationship with humanity and the world</li>
</ul>

<p>This goes much deeper but for the sake of brevity, we will keep the summary version! We enshrined our values in our vision:</p>

  <li>Empowers us to pursue our own learning adventures</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>To fully digitise the construction of human civilisation</li>
  <li>To create a new type of organisation that enables human flourishing while delivering a huge positive impact on society</li>

<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

<p><strong>Can you tell me more about what the role is like?</strong> We are in scale-up mode, so it will be a pretty full-on role with more things to do than time available. This is why it will be important to prioritize and also develop capacity in the team by hiring and holding the team to the highest standards. We don’t like to mess about, so you will need to be a very high performer who only wants to work with others of your ilk. We are growing rapidly, so that means your role will grow rapidly too. You will need to keep up and constantly be looking 1-2 years ahead.</p>

<p><strong>Where would I be working?</strong> All of our roles are 100% remote and home-based. However, if you would like to work in a co-work space to get out of the house, we can arrange that. If you are in one of our locations with offices, you can come as often as you like.</p>

<h3>Salary and Benefits</h3>

<p><strong>Standard Stuff</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Paid Annual Leave 25 days + statutory Bank Holidays</li>
  <li>Flexible hours</li>
  <li>Compensation for this role depends on your capability level and will likely fall in the PHP 836,550 to 2,585,700 annual range.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Life-Changing Stuff</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>4 Day Weeks: That’s right, 4 day weeks</li>
  <li>Grow your whole self: Our leaders are more like coaches and one of our main objectives is to give 5 years’ worth of learning and development for every 1 year with us. You have a coach, mentor, well-being therapist, and a development-orientated environment. That’s literally what our vision is all about and the primary reason Shape exists</li>
  <li>Be surrounded by the best: We only hire and retain the very best people. You might be used to being the smartest in the room, but that won’t be the case in Shape. You will be surrounded by people you can learn from. We are 100% meritocratic, so fast progression is the norm. You will be supported to excel in whichever areas you are most interested in! With Shape, development is unbounded</li>
  <li>Long-term impact: We are focused on solving the biggest issues in construction project delivery in a way that can spread and outlast us</li>
  <li>A generous equity scheme: as a fast-growing consultancy as well as the fact we are building software, this has a huge upside, particularly for people that stay with us through our growth</li>
</ul>
