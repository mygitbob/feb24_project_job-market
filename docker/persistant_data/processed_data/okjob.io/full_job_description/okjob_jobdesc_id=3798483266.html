<h2>Job Description: Lighting Designers</h2>

<p>We're looking for 2 lighting designers to join our practice at Elektra, at junior and intermediate level.</p>

<h3>About Us</h3>

<p>We are a long-established (24 years) award-winning lighting consultancy based in London. Our work focuses on Hotels, Retail, Exterior, and more. With projects all across Europe and the Middle East, Elektra Lighting Design is a great place to work.</p>

<p>Firstly, a major perk - we operate a 4-day week, so Fridays are off every week. We work a full-time 35-hour week (with full pay) spread over Monday to Thursday. Then, we adopted a permanent hybrid part office/part home working pattern. However, we would want you to be in full time for the first few weeks at our office in Holborn to settle in. And if that's not enough, we have an in-house training program and team structure to encourage your development.</p>

<h3>About You</h3>

<p>You should be an enthusiastic, hardworking, creative, and self-motivated individual. We're recruiting at both junior and intermediate levels. For Junior, no experience is needed, but always welcome. For full intermediate, you have commercial use in at least some of Dialux, AutoCAD, InDesign, and Photoshop (and maybe REVIT). You can prepare visuals, renders, have familiarity with some lighting manufacturers, and know your way around a design meeting, along with experience in taking projects (as part of a team or solo) through the design process and possibly some site experience too. Multiple languages are always a bonus (we work across EMEA region).</p>

<p>So if you are anywhere on this range of junior to intermediate, we'd love to hear from you! We are committed to equal opportunities, so we would especially love to hear from you if you are from any sort of minority, even if you don’t think you quite have everything it takes.</p>

<p>Note: Just to be completely clear; we are not product designers. We don’t design light fittings, in the same way that architects do not design bricks. We create well-lit architectural spaces using light.</p>

<p>You must be a UK citizen or already have a work visa; we cannot get a UK work visa for you; we are really sorry about that. Do Not Apply if this is you, and no we will not take you on remotely.</p>

<p>Please send your CV and portfolio immediately, marked “Application for lighting designer position”.</p>
