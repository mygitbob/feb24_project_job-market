<p><strong>About Blackthorn</strong></p>
<p>We have five native apps on the Salesforce AppExchange for managing Events, collecting Payments, sending Messages, protecting Data, and showcasing a virtual Storefront. We're a growing, distributed team in four countries. We move fast and have significant structure in our product build process. Everyone on our team has deep experience within their respective roles. Our customers span from 1 person companies to Fortune 500s.</p>

<p><strong>Why is our work important</strong></p>
<p>Our apps continue to be easy to use and setup, due to continuous refinements with our UX. Most apps in our space take weeks to implement, ours take hours, and they work more flexibly, achieving significantly more functionality than our competitors. We believe enterprise apps should be as easy to use as consumer mobile apps.</p>

<p><strong>What the job will bring you</strong></p>
<p>A deep level of satisfaction through ownership of your role. You'll get more autonomy than at other companies (we've been told by our team). Connection. Our team is tightly knit, assisted through our annual company trip (as we're remote). Challenge. We're trying to move as quick as possible. This is not for you if you want to sit back and chill. As Ray Dalio says about life: "Meaningful work and meaningful relationships" provide meaning to life. We aim to bring this.</p>
