<h2>The Role:</h2>
<p>Digible, Inc. is looking for a Principal Software Engineer to join our team!</p>

<p>The Principal Software Engineer reports to the CTO and is a peer to management leadership. This role involves partnering with engineers and leadership to influence and drive technical strategy across the organization, including Data and Engineering domains. This role is of the “Architect” archetype (following Will Larson’s “Staff Engineer Archetypes” model) helping our team move from having built successful early products to creating a durable product platform that accelerates our momentum into the future.</p>

<p>You will zoom out when developing technical strategies, mentoring engineering leads across the team, and leading efforts to establish standards and technology selection. You will periodically zoom in and contribute to specific deliverables within a given project or team to ensure success and stay connected to the day-to-day work.</p>

<p>As a team, we come from many different backgrounds, countries, and fields of education. We strongly believe this diversity and agility has helped us build an inclusive and empathetic environment, and we are looking forward to adding your perspective!</p>
