<h2>The Data Science team at Signifyd</h2>
<p>The Data Science team at Signifyd builds the models that power our fraud detection engine. Our machine learning pipeline keeps us one step ahead of fraudsters and their constantly evolving tactics and our research and experiments develop into new products that improve the merchant payments experience.</p>

<h3>We expect our data scientists to be hands-on.</h3>
<p>We carry solutions from a brainstorm to experimentation and all the way to deployment. We’re a varied group with a diversity of strengths -- some team members came to us from academic backgrounds, others from engineering, some from big companies and some from small, but all of us are curious and collaborative.</p>

<p>We are looking for someone who embodies our company values:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Curious and Hungry:</strong> Be willing to do research and design experiments by being hands-on</li>
  <li><strong>Tenacious:</strong> Creating something new is hard work, and our Data Scientist team never gives up</li>
  <li><strong>Customer Passion:</strong> Be the backbone to our platform, and help us stay ahead of fraudsters</li>
  <li><strong>Design for Scale:</strong> Work with the rest of the Data Science team to make fraud protection at scale possible</li>
  <li><strong>Agile:</strong> Some days you may spend doing research and designing experiments while others are spent using your analytical toolbox to surface insights into real-time fraud attacks.</li>
  <li><strong>Roll Up Your Sleeves:</strong> Partner closely internally to learn from others, and succeed as a team</li>
</ul>

<h3>How you’ll have an impact:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Building production machine learning models that identify fraud</li>

  <li>Communicating complex ideas effectively to a variety of audiences</li>
  <li>Collaborating with engineering teams to continuously strengthen our machine learning pipeline</li>
  <li>Mentoring other members of the team</li>
</ul>

<h3>Past experience you’ll need:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Bachelor's degree in computer science, applied mathematics, or an analytical field</li>
  <li>An advanced degree (M.S. or Ph.D) in computer science, applied mathematics, or an analytical field is highly preferred</li>
  <li>At least 3+ years of experience</li>
  <li>Hands-on statistical analysis with a solid fundamental understanding</li>
