<h2>About Us</h2>
<p>We are Laminar Projects!</p>
<p>If you have already heard about us, you are probably reading this because you are tired of the typical old-fashioned and chaotic ways of doing things in construction. But in case you haven’t: we are a project engineering consultancy and tech startup hybrid! We help engineering companies who work on capital projects optimise how they use data, whilst developing our own digital products.</p>
<p>We do things the Laminar Way, that is, we bring control and clarity to projects by implementing pragmatic data-driven solutions using a mix of latest technology, our own processes, and a big dose of common sense.</p>

<h2>Missions (What We Are Aiming For)</h2>
<ul>
  <li>To fully digitise the construction of human civilisation</li>
  <li>To create a new type of organisation that enables human flourishing while delivering a huge positive impact on society</li>
</ul>

<p>So, at this point you might be asking what makes us different from other opportunities you might be looking at. Here are a couple of pointers to answer that question:</p>

<ul>
  <li>We aren't a company; we are a team.</li>
  <li>We thrive on being a growing startup, with a dynamic culture and a tight-knit team.</li>
  <li>Our leaders are more like coaches and one of our main objectives is to give <strong>5 years’ worth of learning and development for every 1 year with us.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Gain diverse experience by working on projects of all sizes. You’ll get exposure to multiple projects including flagship projects such as High-Tech manufacturing plants, High-Speed Rail, Hospitals, Nuclear, or Hyperscale data centres for tech giants. <strong>100% of our profits go into R&D projects, including developing our own platform to digitise construction project management.</strong> If there’s an inner tech-y vein pulsing by now, this is the place to be! <strong>Fast and transparent progression based on our development matrix.</strong> This means that our roles and salaries are purely meritocratic, focusing on capability over experience. So, if you have the skills to hop to the next level, you will get reviewed and promoted, simple as that. And if you don’t have the skills yet, you can learn them with us.</p>
