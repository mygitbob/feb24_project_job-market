<h2>About the job</h2>
<p>Ever wondered how it would be to revolutionise one of the least digitised industries in the market, alongside a growing and switched-on team? Read on!</p>

<h2>We are Shape.Construction!</h2>

<p>We are digitising the largest and most fundamental industry in the world, the industry that literally builds the foundations of the civilisation we all depend on to spare us from a brutal hunter-gatherer life: CONSTRUCTION</p>
<p>It is one of the least digitised industries in the world but also the largest – 1 in 9 people globally work in the construction industry and it constitutes 11% of global GDP.</p>
<p>Improving construction strengthens the very foundation of human civilisation.</p>

<p>We got our start as a high-end construction project management consultancy. As a consultancy, we are focused on genuinely upgrading the way construction projects are delivered. We then take the deep understanding of the projects we work on to develop construction management software products that anyone can use to deliver their projects better.</p>

<p>We are building a full suite of products one module at a time – kind of like office 365 but for construction management.</p>

<p>The core of all this is our true secret sauce; people. We only recruit the very best both in capability and personality. We are deeply focused on designing a new type of organisation that is optimised for the flourishing of the people in the team first and foremost. People that join us develop fast as a whole person in ways they never imagined.</p>

<p>This approach has allowed us to grow from just 2 people in 2017 to over 160 today (including consultancy) and we are still very much at the beginning! Joining us isn’t just some “job”, it is a transformative educational experience. We challenge you to be your best self in all aspects of life.</p>

<h2>4 core values for a good life</h2>

<p>We believe a life of human flourishing is all about meaningful relationships with others and challenging yourself to create a positive impact. So our values reflect the 4 levels of relationships that each of us has:</p>

<h3>Grow yourself</h3>
<p>Your relationship with yourself</p>

<h3>Care about people</h3>
<p>Your relationship with others around you</p>

<h3>Execute to greatness</h3>
<p>Your relationship with your team</p>

<h3>Build civilisation</h3>
<p>Your relationship with humanity and the world</p>

<p>This goes much deeper but for the sake of brevity, we will keep the summary version!</p>

<p>We enshrined our values in our vision:</p>

<p>We exist so that everyone in our team can thrive in a high-impact community that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Connects us with meaningful relationships</li>
  <li>Inspires us to develop ourselves to become better humans</li>
  <li>Empowers us to pursue our own learning adventures</li>
</ul>

<p>We believe that, by first doing this, we can achieve the highest levels of value for the world.</p>

<p>And enable the achievement of our vision through our dual missions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>To fully digitise the construction of human civilisation</li>
  <li>To create a new type of organisation that enables human flourishing while delivering a huge positive impact on society</li>
</ul>
