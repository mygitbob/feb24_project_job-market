<p>Stora is a fully remote company, and this is a remote job. For now, we prefer candidates based in the UK, but will consider anywhere with at least 5 hours of overlap with GMT during a normal working day.</p>

<h3>About us</h3>

<p>Stora launched in 2020 aiming to revolutionise the self storage industry. Our platform was designed to solve real-life problems that competitors failed to, and as a result we’ve brought on board hundreds of customers from across the global. We’re a fast-growing company who’ve gained a reputation as innovators in this space, and we plan to keep it that way. Our team is small, focused and love to build world-class software.</p>

<h3>Benefits & compensation</h3>

<p>The annual salary for this position is £70K+ depending on experience. This is for a 4-day work week, working 8 hours per day.</p>

<p>Our benefits are designed to help you lead a healthy life outside of work. That’s why we work a 4-day week and offer flexible working hours.</p>

<p>While this is a remote position we also give you the opportunity to connect in real life too, with an optional team day every Thursday in Belfast, or during one of our two company meet ups each year.</p>

<p>To help you do your best work, we provide you with a laptop of your choice and a WFH budget to create your ideal work environment.</p>

<p>Beyond this we offer private health insurance for you and your direct family members, a company pension, 28 days paid annual leave per year and share options.</p>

<h3>How to apply</h3>

<p>Please submit an application that speaks directly to this position via the form at the URL below. Applications submitted via LinkedIn will not be considered.</p>

<p>Share a bit about yourself and what you think you could contribute to Stora. Tell us about work you’re most proud of and what truly inspires you. Please also attach your CV or share any links you think are relevant, such as LinkedIn or GitHub.</p>

<p>The deadline for applications is 25th January 2024.</p>

<p>We encourage applicants of all different backgrounds and identities to apply. We believe that our work is stronger with a variety of perspectives, and we’re eager to further diversify our company. We are dedicated to fostering an inclusive and supportive environment for you to do the best work of your career.</p>

<h3>What happens next?</h3>

<p>Should you progress to the interview phase, you'll hear from us within 2 weeks of the deadline. Anticipate 2-3 remote interviews, each lasting 30–60 minutes, with our principal engineers scheduled at your convenience. We will discuss your background, approach, and professional experience. Nothing too crazy - we just want to get a feel for your experience and an idea of how you think you may be able to help us build the next phases of Stora.</p>

<p>Following the interviews, our final candidates may be asked to complete an at-home project that should take no more than four hours. This exercise reflects the nature of our work and enables us to better evaluate your capabilities.</p>

<p>We appreciate your consideration and look forward to hearing from you.</p>
