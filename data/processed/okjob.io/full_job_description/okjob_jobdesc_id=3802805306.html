<h3>About our tech & team</h3>

<p>Checkout Everywhere, is a small cross-functional team based in US and Europe, building a whole new offering within the Bolt ecosystem.

We believe it is possible to have fun and learn amazing things with great people around you, while doing meaningful work in a sustainable way. Be good and do good!</p>

<h3>About our tech</h3>

<p>In order to enable commerce everywhere, our main ongoing technical challenge is to grow the transactional inventory of rich products, refine it and allow our partners to use these products on their surfaces - websites, mobile apps or literally anything. We work with high-frequency product changes - importing large volumes of products from other sources into one data lake, refining them using AI & ML, all based on the Kafka event-stream, to then be available on a near-zero latency checkout.</p>

<ul>
  <li>.NET Core, Go, Node.JS React, TypeScript, Astro</li>
  <li>MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Kafka, SNS/SQS</li>
  <li>AWS, Netlify, K8S, Github Actions</li>
</ul>

<p>We believe in pragmatic approach and proven choices, but we are not afraid of experimenting. Our code is mostly strongly typed and well tested and hosted on AWS. Our fundamental organizational and architectural direction is to design teams around full autonomy and responsibility over their product and engineering, but with the strong focus on transparency and written culture (ie. technical design process). On top of that, product teams are supported by the platform team, whose goal is to increase the developer experience and make the engineering experience seamless.</p>
