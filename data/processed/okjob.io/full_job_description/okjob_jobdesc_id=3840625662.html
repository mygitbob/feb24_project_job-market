The SEO Specialist works closely with the Marketing Analyst, Digital Strategist, Digital Marketing Specialist (DMS) and also the Digital Marketing Manager (DMM) to consistently improve client ROI. While the primary focus of the role is on complete SEO-based work, conversion rate optimization (CRO) is also a part of the role.
