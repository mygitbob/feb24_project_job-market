We are digitising the largest and most fundamental industry in the world, the industry that literally builds the foundations of the civilisation we all depend on to spare us from a brutal hunter-gatherer life: CONSTRUCTION. It is one of the least digitised industries in the world but also the largest – 1 in 9 people globally work in the construction industry and it constitutes 11% of global GDP. Improving construction strengthens the very foundation of human civilisation.

We are building a full suite of products one module at a time – kind of like office 365 but for construction management.
